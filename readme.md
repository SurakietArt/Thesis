# Wind Tunnel

Thesis discusses the study of the Measurement of lift force on aircraft wings in a low speed wind tunnel. The objective of thesis is to design the measurement of lifting force to get the most accurate value according to the simulation results by ANSYS program.


# Theory

A fluid flowing around the surface of an object exerts a force on it. Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction. It contrasts with the drag force, which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction. Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of gravity, but it can act in any direction at right angles to the flow.

This diagram show data flow from sensor to reciver for collect the data and send it to computer (Excel) via PLX-DAQ to calculate lift force.
